# Base Docker Images Repository

## Overview

This repository provides a collection of base Docker images designed for various applications and development environments. Each image is optimized for minimal size while including essential dependencies and configurations. The goal is to facilitate the rapid deployment of applications across different platforms, ensuring consistency and reliability.

### Features

- **Lightweight Images**: Built on minimal base layers to reduce the overall image size and improve performance.
- **Pre-Configured Environments**: Each image includes necessary dependencies for common programming languages and frameworks, such as Python, Node.js, and others.
- **Customizable**: Users can extend or modify base images to fit their specific project needs.
- **Version Control**: Images are versioned to maintain compatibility and allow for easy updates.
- **Documentation**: Each image includes clear instructions on how to use and extend it, making it easy for developers to get started.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories for each base image. Each directory contains:

- **Dockerfile**: The file used to build the Docker image.
- **README.md**: Documentation specific to that image, including usage examples and installation instructions.
- **requirements.txt** or other dependency files: Specifies libraries and packages required for the image.
- **Example Scripts**: Sample code or scripts demonstrating the functionality of the image.
